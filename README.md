# URL Protocol Converter

A simple, standalone web app that converts protocol URLs (like steam://) to shareable HTTPS links that work on any platform. Perfect for sharing URLs that normally aren't clickable on social media, chat platforms, or other websites.

## How it Works

1. Using the web interface at [steadirect.com](https://steadirect.com), or by creating URLs directly:
   ```
   https://steadirect.com/?url=steam://joinlobby/1131190/109775241747665514
   ```

2. When someone clicks the generated link, the app automatically redirects them to the original protocol URL:
   ```
   steam://joinlobby/1131190/109775241747665514
   ```

## Examples

The converter works with any protocol URL, for example:

```
steam://joinlobby/1131190/109775241747665514
discord://discord.com/channels/123456789
```

Generated shareable link:
```
https://steadirect.com/?url=steam://joinlobby/1131190/109775241747665514
```

The app can also be self-hosted - it will automatically use whatever domain it's running on to generate the correct links.
